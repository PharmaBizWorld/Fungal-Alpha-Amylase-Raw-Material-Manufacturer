About Fungal Alpha Amylase
Fungal Alpha Amylase is an enzyme derived from fungal sources, primarily Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger. It functions by hydrolyzing starch into shorter polysaccharides and dextrins, making it an essential component in various industrial processes. Unlike bacterial amylase, fungal amylase operates optimally in acidic conditions, making it highly suitable for applications requiring lower pH levels.
